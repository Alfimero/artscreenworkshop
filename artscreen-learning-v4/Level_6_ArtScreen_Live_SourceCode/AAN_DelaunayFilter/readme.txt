Creates a delaunay triangulation of the significant points of a picture. For the edge detection it convolutes image pixels with a Sobel kernel.
For the triangulation I used a custom refactoring of the Triangulate library by Florian Jennet, that implements a qhull algorithm ported from Paul Bourke's work.

There's no interaction.
