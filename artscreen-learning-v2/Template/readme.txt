    You should install the following libraries:

The ArtScreen library provides the following public variables:

PImage motionImage;
boolean movementDetected = false;
PVector maxMotionLocation = new PVector(0, 0);
MotionPixel[] top100MotionPixels = new MotionPixel[] {};
	A motion pixel has location and changeAmount

	class MotionPixel {
		PVector location;
		byte changeAmount;
	}

PImage camSmall;
PImage camSmallMirror;
Capture cam; // processing video capture
int captureWidth;
int captureHeight;

// convert smaller camera images to screen coordinates
cameraXToScreen(float x, float srcWidth)
cameraYToScreen(float y, float srcHeight)



All the variables can be accessed via the artScreen object you created, like:

artScreen.camSmallMirror
artScreen.motionImage

etc…
