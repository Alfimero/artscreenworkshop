    Live Sketch Archive

/////////////
This is the archive of all sketches that are running live on the Art Screen.

They do not contain any libraries in the code folder, because Art Screen Library
and Large Sketch Viewer library are already installed on that machine.
If you want to run live sketches on your own computer it would be easier to grab
the versions from the artscreen-learning folder
